Multiple models that classify sentences from medical papers into 5 categories (METHODS, RESULTS, CONCLUSIONS, BACKGROUND, OBJECTIVE), making them easier to read.

At the core of this project is the implementation of a deep learning model inspired by the renowned 2017 paper, "PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts." This model serves as a cornerstone, incorporating state-of-the-art methodologies to effectively analyze and categorize sentences within medical papers.

The objective was to streamline the well known comprehensive medical literature by organizing content into meaningful sections. By automating the classification process, the project significantly reduces the time and effort required for researchers to extract information from medical papers.
