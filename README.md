# Classification of sentences from abstracts of medical papers using TensorFlow
The focus of the project was classification of sentences from abstracts of medical papers into 5 categories (METHODS, RESULTS, CONCLUSIONS, BACKGROUND, OBJECTIVE), making them easier to read.

Multiple modelling experiments were done in this project, one of them representing the implementation of a deep learning model inspired by the renowned 2017 paper, "PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts." This model serves as a cornerstone, incorporating state-of-the-art methodologies to effectively analyze and categorize sentences within medical papers.

The objective was to streamline the well known comprehensive medical literature by organizing content into meaningful sections. By automating the classification process, the project significantly reduces the time and effort required for researchers to extract information from medical papers.
